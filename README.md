# YamBenson.github.io

This is a project I made back in high school (2020).

This project was a website that received historical stock quotes from an API and graphed this information onto an interactive candlestick chart.

This project was created using different open-source resources and taught me the importance of having readable code because I had to learn how 
various open-source codes functioned in order to create a synergy between them to make an online price charting software.
